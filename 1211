## ✅ Does Cash App Offer Its Own Gift Cards?

As of now, **Cash App does not issue its own gift cards**. That means you cannot walk into a store or go online and buy a “Cash App gift card” like you would with Amazon, iTunes, or Visa/Mastercard gift cards.

Any advertisement or message claiming to sell or give away a Cash App gift card is likely **fraudulent** and should be avoided. Cash App themselves has issued statements warning users not to engage with third-party “Cash App gift card” offers, as they are commonly used in scams.

## 🛒 Can You Use Other Gift Cards on Cash App?

You may be wondering if you can link other types of gift cards to your Cash App account. Here's what you need to know:

* **Visa, Mastercard, American Express, or Discover prepaid cards**: Some of these can be added to your Cash App account, but with limitations. You may be able to **send money** using a prepaid card, but **you cannot deposit funds from Cash App back onto the card**.

* **Retail-specific gift cards (Amazon, Walmart, etc.)**: These cannot be used with Cash App. The platform only supports traditional debit and credit cards issued by banks or certain prepaid card providers.
